# Internet Of Things
Me and my collegue attended the course "Internet of Things" at Politecnico of Milan. 
The course provided the basics on the four major building blocks of the Internet of Things: the reference hardware, the communication technologies, the management 
platforms and the data storage/processing solutions. The course started off by overviewing the most common hardware components of sensor nodes, and will then moved to 
addressing the challenges which had to be faced to interconnect and manage such tiny devices. In this field, low power short rannge and long range communication 
technologies were reviewed. Finally, the course described the main features and requirements of management platform commonly used to orchestrate IoT systems. 
In practice we did four challenges using 
  1.Wireshark to understand the attributes of packets that were in the network 
  2.Generate a message from a file CSV to be sent in my ThingSpeak channel thourgh Node-Red using MQTT 
  3.Sending message from a mote to my ThingSpeak channel using MQTT 
  4.Simulation of an application with two motes that interact with each other, where the first mote periodicallu requestes the second one which will 
    answer after a certain amount of time.

Finally, we did a project on smart bracelets. In particular we've to design, implement and test a software prototype for a smart bracelet. 
The bracelet is worn by a child and her/his parent to keep track of the childâ€™s position and trigger alerts when a child goes too far.
