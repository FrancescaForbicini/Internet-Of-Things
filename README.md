# Internet Of Things
My colleague and I attended the course "Internet of Things" at Politecnico of Milan. The course provided the basics of the four major building blocks of the Internet of Things: the reference hardware, the communication technologies, the management platforms and the data storage/processing solutions. The course started by overviewing the most common hardware components of sensor nodes and then moved to address the challenges which had to be faced to interconnect and manage such tiny devices. In this field, low-power short-range and long-range communication technologies were reviewed. Finally, the course described the main features and requirements of the management platform commonly used to orchestrate IoT systems. In practice, we did four challenges using


1.Wireshark to understand the attributes of packets that were in the network

2.Generate a message from a file CSV to be sent in my ThingSpeak channel through Node-Red using MQTT

3.Sending some messages from a mote to my ThingSpeak channel using MQTT

4.Simulation of an application with two motes that interact with each other, where the first mote periodically requested the second one which will answer after a certain amount of time.

Finally, we did a project on smart bracelets. In particular, we've to design, implement and test a software prototype for a smart bracelet. The bracelet is worn by a child and her/his parent to keep track of the childâ€™s position and trigger alerts when a child goes too far.
